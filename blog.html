            <strong>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

            <br>
            <strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural
                intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study
                of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that
                maximize its chance of achieving its goals.[a]

            <h1> Machine Learning </h1>
            <br>
            <strong>Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks

            <h1> Blockchain </h1>
            <br>
            <strong>A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leafs). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
